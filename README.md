#jacknetumpd
jacknetumpd is a Linux daemon designed specifically for the Zynthian Open Source Synthesizer : https://zynthian.org/ but nothing prevents it to be used on any other Linux machine.

The daemon is used by the Zynthian to create the Network UMP endpoint which can be activated via the Zynthian's Admin menu.

In order to compile the daemon, you will need files from these libraries :
